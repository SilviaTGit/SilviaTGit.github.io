          Graduated with a Master&apos;s degree in Foreign Languages for International Business, I possess advanced skills in English, French, and Italian. My academic journey has provided a strong foundation in digital marketing, international, and European law. After my experience as an Export Sales Assistant, where I refined the management of international relations and intercultural communication, I decided to follow my passion for technology, specializing in Web development. I combine my technical skills with a global vision and marketing strategies, creating solid digital solutions, optimized for business and compliant with international regulations.
